# Tensorbarrel

Tensorbarrel is my homebrew machine learning framework with the goal of being able to learn more about how machine learning works and the mathematics behind it.

The goal is to implement popular machine learning aspects like multi-layer perceptron, backpropagation, gradient descent, convolution, attention???? and other interesting technologies.

> [!WARNING]
> Tensorbarrel is not production ready (and likely will never be). If you find yourself 
debating between tensorbarrel and some other framework like PyTorch or Tensorflow, you done screwed up.
